# Hammerhand SIEM Senior Project

NOTE: The Hammerhand SIEM software system currently operates in a cloud environment and on endpoint devices. The project focuses heavily on container management, configuring devices with preexisting software, alerting rules, and data pipelining. Thus, this repositority only contains a copy of the Python script running our data enrichment and is **not** representative of the entire software system.
